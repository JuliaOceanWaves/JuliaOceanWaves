This repository contains packages for modeling wave energy converters, including 
* wave modeling
* wave-structure interactions
* multi-body dynamics 

Collaboration is welcome! 🎉 

The goal is to develop a full Julia suite of modeling tools to 
* enable differentiable programming: gradient-based optimization, data-driven methods, etc.
* address the two-language problem, e.g. Python+Fortran
* enable parallelization and GPU computing
